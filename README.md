# AI Product Manager Nanodegree
In this repo, I will cover all aspects and give a feedback for the AI Product Manager Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Overview
This ultimate goal of the AI Product Manager Nanodegree program is to help students learn the unique skills that define the success of a machine learning product. Students will learn how to identify business cases that can benefit from AI technologies, and implement best practices for designing datasets and product prototypes. A graduate of this program will be able to:

* Decide to use an unsupervised, supervised, or deep learning model when approaching a specific problem.
* Design a data annotation job to create a novel dataset.
* Build predictive models using automated machine learning tools.
* Compare the performances of learned models using suitable metrics.
* Prototype, test, and iterate on an AI product.

## Projects
One of the main goals at Udacity is to help students create a job-ready portfolio of completed projects. Building a project is one of the best ways to test the skills students’ve acquired and to demonstrate your newfound abilities to future employers or colleagues. Throughout this Nanodegree program, students’ll have the opportunity to prove their skills by building the following projects:

* **Create a Medical Image Annotation Job**, Design a labeled dataset that distinguishes between x-ray images that indicate health or pneumonia in lungs; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a diagnostic product.

* **Build a Model with Google AutoML**, Build a variety of different medical image classification models using Google Cloud AutoML. You’ll have the opportunity to observe how properties of the data impact the models’ results.
     
* **Create an AI Product Business Proposal**, Put together all that you’ve learned to submit a final proposal for an AI product that considers users, design practices, and the type of machine learning model you might use in the product.

## Course 1: Introduction to AI in Business

AI enables innovation by automating tasks that were previously repetitive, and time-consuming. Today, it seems like every business either depends fundamentally on the capabilities of AI, or seeks to rapidly upskill its workforce to compete in the new, AI world. Learn the foundations of AI and machine learning, starting with the unsupervised and supervised models that are used in industry today. Understand how to develop a clear, narrow business case for an AI application. Learn how and when to use AI in a product based on business metrics and data availability.
